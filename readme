What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Yes, it was helpful, especially in learning about pointers.
Not sure if I would use the word fun, as it took me very long.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Nothing in particular was buggy. For StrSearch, I did initially get 
an error that my code was "too nested", so it might take a second 
to understand. It does pass all tests, however.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, the functions cannot use assert to check if the 
destination memory is large enough because 
they don't know the size of the memory 
which has been allocated by the caller. 

If we don't know the buffer size, there is no way
to know if there is adequate space for 
copy or concatenation functions.
